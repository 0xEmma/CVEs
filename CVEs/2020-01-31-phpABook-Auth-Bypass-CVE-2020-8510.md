# phpABook Auth Bypass in Version 0.9i

---

In the application (phpABook)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpabook/] the authentication is able to be bypassed by setting a cookie in your browser with the name "userInfo" and a value of "admin+1+en"(format is user+perms+lang). This allows anyone without privilege's to login as any user(even ones that dont exist) with admin perms.
